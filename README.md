# BW Programming Assignment

first, clone the repo:
```
git clone git@github.com:amozgovoy/bw_pa.git
cd bw_pa
```

function:
```
bw_brackets_pa.py
```

unit test:
```
test_bw_brackets_pa.py
```

I've used Python 3.7.0, but it should work with previous 3.x versions as well

to use the function in your own app:
```python
from bw_brackets_pa import solution
print(solution("{}{foo{}"))
```

to run the unittest:
```
python -m unittest -v test_bw_brackets_pa.py
```
